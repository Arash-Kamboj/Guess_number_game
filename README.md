# Guess Number Game

🎮 Welcome to the Guess Number Game! 

I created this project to sharpen my skills of user-defined functions, conditional statements and loops in Python.

🚀 **Getting Started**

To begin playing, follow these steps:

1️⃣ **Open in Colab**: Click on the "Open in Colab" button to access the code in Google Colab.
   
2️⃣ **Run the Code**: Once in Colab, run the code by clicking on the play button or pressing `Shift + Enter`. This will execute the game script.

3️⃣ **Guess the Number**: The game will randomly select a number between 0 and 100. Your objective is to guess this number in as few attempts as possible.

4️⃣ **Input Your Guess**: Enter your guess when prompted by the program. If your guess is too high or too low, the program will give you hints to guide you towards the correct answer.

5️⃣ **Repeat Until You Win**: Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number. The game will congratulate you upon winning!

6️⃣ **Play Again**: Want to play again? Simply rerun the code in Colab and enjoy another round of guessing fun!

Good luck and happy gaming! 🍀🎉
